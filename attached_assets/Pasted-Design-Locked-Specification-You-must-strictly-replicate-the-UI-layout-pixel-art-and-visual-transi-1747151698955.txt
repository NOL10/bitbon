üß† Core Features & Interactions
1. üéØ BTC Price Tracker

Source: CoinGecko API
GET https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd
Compare current price to:
24h previous close (default)
OR a user-defined custom anchor
2. üå± Visual Growth States (from image sheet)

Based on % change since anchor/previous close, show exact corresponding bonsai visual:

from plant look on percentage changes.png and individual state PNGs.
Mapping Logic:

% Change	Image File
ATH +30%‚Üë	all time high.png
+30%	Final green bonsai (from sheet)
+20%	Mid bonsai (from sheet)
+10%	Small bonsai (from sheet)
0%	Empty pot (base state)
-10%	Wilted bonsai (from sheet)
-20%	Dry/red bonsai
-30%	Cracked pot + dry bonsai
ATL (below min)	all time low.png
Image switching must match exact visuals from the assets and never exceed them.

3. ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Threshold UI

Use app settings.png as the reference to:

Adjust Positive thresholds (default: +10%, +20%, +30%)
Adjust Negative thresholds (default: -10%, -20%, -30%)
Set custom anchor price
All changes should persist across app restarts using local storage.
